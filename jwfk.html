            <p>3 years after Jurassic World, J A Bayona directed Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom, a film that destroyed the iconic island, Isla Nublar and proposed an intresting what if <scenario class=""></scenario></p>
            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>Six months after the demise of the Jurassic World theme park on Isla Nublar, a group of mercenaries are sent to Isla Nublar to recover the bones of the Indominus rex from the Jurassic World lagoon for the creation of a new genetically modified hybrid: the Indoraptor.[1] An underwater submersible is sent down and retrieves a rib bone, and sends it up on a buoy before it is attacked by the Mosasaurus. The people on land who opened the gate to the lagoon lose contact with the submarine pilots. The gate starts to close and a Dilophosaurus can be heard running away in the jungle. The trees nearby shake and Jurassic World's veteran Tyrannosaurus rex attacks the group. Jack is left on the ground and their helicopter lets down a rope ladder. They escape the Tyrannosaurus, but Jack is then swallowed by the Mosasaurus after it jumps into the air and it escapes from its enclosure.</p>
            <p>In 2018, Claire Dearing, the former park manager, has now founded the Dinosaur Protection Group, an organization dedicated to saving and protecting the dinosaurs. After the government refuses to fund a rescue operation to save the dinosaurs (as advised by Ian Malcolm), Claire is summoned to the estate of Sir Benjamin Lockwood, an old business partner of John Hammond, who agrees to fund the rescue mission and bring the dinosaurs to a new sanctuary island where they will be left to live on their own, safe from human interference. Lockwood's assistant, Eli Mills, asks Claire to recruit Owen Grady, a former raptor trainer who worked at the park, to find and capture Blue, the last surviving Velociraptor. Claire goes to recruit Owen who initially is reluctant and skeptical over saving the dinosaurs at all. However when he later rewatches old videos of Blue as a baby, Owen decides to join Claire's team.</p>
            <p>At Lockwood Manor, Maisie Lockwood, Sir Benjamin's young granddaughter, teases housekeeper Iris with a jump scare in the Museum Parlor. After Iris berates Maisie for her sense of humor, Maisie goes to speak with her grandfather. Lockwood mentions how much Maisie is like her mother which leads Maisie to ask if she "looks like her" which troubles Iris. Lockwood, however, tells her that she does and also tells his granddaughter that her mother once visited Jurassic Park "a long time ago" and that she too - like the Dinosaur Protection Group - would've tried to save the dinosaurs.</p>
            <p>Claire and Owen then set off on a charter plane with Zia Rodriguez, a paleo-veterinarian, and Franklin Webb, an IT expert, both from the Dinosaur Protection Group. Once their plane lands, the group is surprised to find a large base camp has already been set up, and they are met by Ken Wheatley, a big game and trophy hunter serving as the "expedition facilitator". They all set off along with a group of mercenaries to reactivate an abandoned radio communications tower that they will use to find the dinosaurs via their RFID chip implants. Along the way while passing through the Jurassic World main street, they encounter a Brachiosaurus, the first dinosaur Zia has seen in real life.</p>
            <p>Owen, Zia, Wheatley and some of the mercenaries go to find Blue. Owen suggests that he set out on his own to find Blue, and the others stay behind at the truck. When Owen comes upon the fallen Explorer 04 near the old Tyrannosaur Paddock of the old Jurassic Park, Blue jumps out and Owen tries to bond with her before she is tranquilized by Wheatley and his mercenaries. Angry, Blue tackles a mercenary and kills him but not before drawing his sidearm and shooting her, much to Wheatley's and Owen's dismay. Owen tries to attack Wheatley but Wheatley tranquilizes him and threatens to shoot Zia. Zia says that she is the only one who can keep Blue alive and Wheatley has his men put their weapons down.</p>
            <p>Mt. Sibo erupts, causing the mercenaries protecting Claire and Franklin to panic and drive off, locking them inside the old communications center. A Baryonyx surprises them by crawling through an old tunnel, but is temporarily held at bay by falling lava. Franklin and Claire narrowly escape through an emergency ladder and lock the Baryonyx inside the communications center. Owen awakes from his unconsciousness, but is still mostly immobile. He is surprised by a Sinoceratops, which plays with him for a little while before getting scared off and running away from the approaching lava which crawls toward Owen but he manages to (barely) escape just before he is engulfed by the lava. He runs into Claire and Franklin and yells at them repeatedly to "Run", the three elude the lava and falling debris and magma bombs, while avoiding getting trampled by the stampeding dinosaurs.</p>
            <p>Franklin and Claire both hide inside a Gyrosphere, when a Carnotaurus appears and fights a Sinoceratops, before being pinned down and killed by the T. rex who also makes a run for it. Franklin, Claire, and Owen make a run from the burning ash, Owen is slowed down a bit by the ash, but Claire and Franklin fall off the edge with several other dinosaurs. The magma bombs break the Gyrosphere, and Claire and Franklin almost drown, but are able to survive when Owen opens one of the doors using his survival knife. Crawling up on the beach, they see several of the dinosaurs, such as the Baryonyx and T. rex all being captured, The mercenaries on the ship called the Arcadia begin caging all of the captured dinosaurs, Wheatley takes a pair of pliers and yanks a tooth out of a tranquilized Stegosaurus, Owen, Claire, and Franklin also see Blue being tended to by Zia who has been captured, then the three use a truck to drive on the ship, which is leaving the island, they only barely make it, and watch the island burn up in the background. A trapped Brachiosaurus calls out to the departing ship before being engulfed by the ash and perishing.</p>
            <p>Eli is disappointed by the lack of progress and meets with Gunnar Eversol, an auctioneer who he hopes will help sell the dinosaurs in a grand auction. Maisie overhears their conversation and learns of their plan. Eli takes Gunnar to a lab, where he reveals that they are creating a new dinosaur, called the Indoraptor, and potentially other improvements in its wake for the sake of military interests and warfare. The current specimen being a prototype, and their plan to use it for militaristic purposes (and act upon Vic Hoskins' original plans for the Indominus Rex). Maisie attempts to tell Sir Benjamin, but he seemingly believes she misheard them and sends her off to bed.</p>
            <p>Owen, Claire, and Franklin find Zia and Blue as Zia is trying to stop Blue from hemorrhaging. Owen tells Zia that the mercenaries are animal traffickers planning to sell all of the dinosaurs which prompts Zia to mention that Blue won't be sold since she believes she's wanted for a different purpose. Zia further tells them that before she can treat Blue's gunshot wound, she needs a ready blood transfusion for Blue just in case. Unfortunately (much to Claire's chagrin), the only blood match on the ship would belong to a tranquilized T. rex on board and inside one of the transport trucks, and so Zia sends both Owen and Claire to retrieve some of the live dinosaur's blood. They find the Tyrannosaur and successfully get her blood but are locked in by some of the guards as the T. rex wakes up. As the agitated animal begins to freak out and thrash violently, Claire escapes through the top and opens the main doors of the cage; Owen narrowly escapes the T. rexâ€™s snapping jaws before she can bite him in half. Zia then operates on Blue and successfully gets the bullet out of her wound.</p>
            <p>While Blue's operation occurs on the Arcadia, Maisie, having observed Mills entering the passcode for the mansion's elevator the previous day, secretly enters the laboratory and watches several clips of Owen training the Velociraptors on Isla Nublar. Her exploration is interrupted by Mills and Dr. Henry Wu; the latter is extremely stressed about Blue's condition. Maisie, in an attempt to escape the two men, backs into a corridor and encounters the caged Indoraptor, who reaches out and gently strokes her hair from behind. Maisie screams, alerting the attention of Mills, who angrily escorts her upstairs and locks her in her bedroom. Mills orders Iris to keep Maisie in her room but Iris then tells Mills Sir Benjamin needs to speak to him. Privately, Lockwood confronts Mills about the latter's true intention of selling the dinosaurs in an auction, angered that Mills has crossed him and used his own mansion as the auction's venue. Ordered by Lockwood to call the police himself, Mills instead murders Lockwood by smothering him with a pillow.</p>
            <p>The DPG awaken aboard the Arcadia the ship docks in Northern California. Owen, Claire, and Franklin try to sneak off the ship but Franklin is caught and mistaken for one of the deck crew. Zia helps cover for Franklin by saying she needed his help and Franklin is taken along with the rest of the crew to load out the dinosaurs. Claire and Owen sneak onto an empty transport truck and drive off with the entire convoy en route to Lockwood Manor. However the two are recognized by a mercenary who warns Wheatley and captures the two before they can drive off to warn the authorities.</p>
            <p>Mills and Wheatley have Owen and Claire imprisoned in the subbasement animal pens with the dinosaurs and Mills calls the two out on their past sins & actions which contributed to dinosaurs being exploited and harmed. Owen nearly breaks Mills' arm before Claire pulls Mills forward to hit his head on the cage bars. Bidders soon arrive for the auction and Maisie escapes her room from the outside rooftops to get to Sir Benjamin's room to warn him. However she finds Sir Benjamin dead and flees down the dumbwaiter chute to avoid being caught by Mills again.</p>
            <p>The auction begins to take place with Eversol speaking to customers of various national backgrounds. Several species from Isla Nublar are presented and bought by guests at the auction and some being driven off to places far away. As the auction occurs, Owen manages to trick a juvenile Stygimoloch into breaking down the concrete wall of the pen with its dome head before further tricking it into breaking the cell door. As Owen and Claire get out they run into Maisie whom Claire remembers from her meeting with Lockwood. Maisie also recognizes Owen from the videos on Wu's computer. In her grief at losing her grandfather, Maisie sobs in Owen's arms and Claire and Owen decide to take Maisie along with them in order to get out of the Manor and shutdown Mills' plans.</p>
            <p>Finally the last animal of the auction is presented in full view: The Indoraptor. Owen, Claire, and Maisie (through the maintenance vents) witness the Indoraptor's reveal and Maisie tells Claire that it was created by Wu. Amazed by the creature's ability to lock onto a specific target (courtesy of a laser and an acoustic signal on a gun), the attendees begin to bid on the Indoraptor despite Eversol stating he is not for sale. Eversol is then coaxed by Mills to accept bids, much to Wu's disdain as the prototype Indoraptor lacks Blue's genome - and thus can neither empathize nor follow more specific orders (as well as if it is sold, the data in its DNA could be remade by another party). Understanding that the Indoraptor is far too dangerous to be sold, Owen disrupts the auction's proceedings with the aid of the Stygimoloch and wreaks havoc among the spectators. Mills flees and orders his men to get the Indoraptor out of Lockwood Manor. Owen bests several mercenaries in hand-to-hand combat, then reverses a switch which prevents the Indoraptor's cage from exiting the auction room.</p>
            <p>Immediately after everyone flees the auction, Wheatley enters the deserted auction room and notices the Indoraptor. Having never seen the creature before and wanting one of its teeth for his necklace, Wheatley shoots the Indoraptor with two tranquilizer darts and enters the cage after the Indoraptor appears to be sedated. In reality, the Indoraptor is unaffected by the tranquilizer darts; he smiles and distracts Wheatley by waving his tail in the air before severing Wheatley's right arm and devouring him.</p>
            <p>His death is witnessed by Eversol who makes a dash for the elevator (without being spotted by the hybrid), where all the other executives were hiding, but pushes a woman out of the way so he can access the code to close the elevator, causing her to scream at the sight of the Indoraptor, who rushes at the still open elevator but the doors successfully close before the Indoraptor can reach them; however, the hybrid (either with intent or by chance) uses its tail to cut off the power supply to the auction room, which automatically reopens the elevator door. The Indoraptor then proceeds to maul Eversol and the other executives to death.</p>
            <p>Owen reunites with Claire and Maisie and the three encounter Mills and two security guards in the mansion's basement. Mills argues with Claire and Owen, the latter two believing they can still stop Mills to which Mills says they cannot undo the changes to the world that started with Hammond and Lockwood first creating dinosaurs. After unsuccessfully trying to coax Maisie to come with him, Mills reveals to Owen, Claire, and Maisie that she is actually a clone of Lockwood's beloved daughter who had perished in a car accident many years prior. He used the technology that cloned extinct dinosaurs to clone his daughter (and had it in the subbasement of Lockwood Manor). As Owen, Claire and Maisie process this revelation, the Indoraptor suddenly appears and kills the two security guards, prompting the others to flee.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Franklin - now disguised as a laboratory assistant - manages to find Zia who is handcuffed to Blue's cage. Wu has begun evacuating the lab to secure all the genome data and still needs Blue's blood. He orders Zia to get Blue's blood for him to which Zia reveals to Wu that she had given Blue a transfusion of T. rex blood, thus making her now "impure" in Wu's eyes. Franklin then injects 20 cc's of Carfentanil into Wu's neck, incapacitating him, before freeing Zia. the two try to flee but are cornered by two mercenaries. This leads Zia to unleash Blue who acknowledges the two for saving her before attacking the mercenaries. As Zia and Franklin flee to safety, Blue kills the two gunmen and escapes the laboratory before a massive explosion occurs - the brief battle had caused damage to several tanks of hydrogen gas within the laboratory.</p>
            <p>Owen, Claire and Maisie take refuge on the main floor of Lockwood's mansion, in the skeleton and replica display room. They notice a human corpse on the ground near a Agujaceratops skull; as they approach it, the Indoraptor reveals himself and pulls the corpse farther behind the skull. The three protagonists take refuge against one of the walls of the skull's casing, but the Indoraptor successfully locates their vantage point by tracking their scent and climbing on top of the Agujaceratops skull. The Indoraptor chases Owen, Claire and Maisie up a spiraling staircase before the three escape into a power supply room, where Owen turns off the entire mansion's power.</p>
            <p>Zia and Franklin discover a hydrogen cyanide leak near the laboratory, which will kill all of the dinosaurs if it spreads to the encaging area. Franklin resets the control system in order to restore power to the mansion. At this time, Owen, Claire and Maisie are hiding behind a diorama of a Velociraptor and Dilophosaurus engaged in battle near a glass wall. Maisie soon realizes that she is staring into the face of the Indoraptor through the glass wall and shrieks in terror; the Indoraptor breaks the wall and pursues the group once again, injuring Claire's leg with his toe claw in the process. The Indoraptor chases Maisie up another staircase and down a hallway until Maisie escapes up to her bedroom, where she takes refuge in her bed.</p>
            <p>Owen is urged to take care of Maisie by the injured Claire; the two share a passionate kiss before Owen leaves to search for Maisie. The Indoraptor, who by this point has ascended to the mansion's roof, lets out a demonic screech and descends the building until he reaches the windows leading to Maisie's room. Hanging upside down, the Indoraptor opens one of the windows and enters Maisie's room, slowly approaching her bed as she begins to shiver and cry. Just before the villainous hybrid attacks, Owen enters Maisie's bedroom and shoots the Indoraptor multiple times with live ammunition. The Indoraptor is unaffected, and stands back up to face Owen. Blue enters Maisie's bedroom and confronts the Indoraptor; the two begin a vicious fight as Owen and Maisie escape the bedroom.</p>
            <p>The Indoraptor fends off Blue and traps Owen and Maisie on the glass roof of the display room. Just before the Indoraptor pounces, Claire appears and coaxes him into attacking Owen with the laser and acoustic signal on the same gun used in the auction demonstration. The Indoraptor charges towards Owen and falls through the glass roof; however, he manages to grab ahold of a rafter connecting the glass panes together and pulls himself back atop the roof. Blue suddenly appears and jumps onto the Indoraptor, causing both to fall down into the display room. The Indoraptor falls directly onto the horns of the Agujaceratops skull, which impales and kills him, while Blue lands on top of the hybrid's corpse and escapes. Franklin and Zia enter and reunite with Owen, Claire and Maisie, and the five protagonists escape the battleground.</p>
            <p>However, a new issue looms; the dinosaurs are trapped in a room that is flooded by noxious hydrogen cyanide. Claire releases all of the dinosaursâ€™ cages one by one. Claire puts her hand on the red button that would release all of them from the entire building, but Owen discourages Claire to do so, thus making Claire resist because she does not want the dinosaurs to destroy the world. However, Maisie pushes the button anyway, releasing the captive dinosaurs, allowing them to escape to the mainland, exclaiming, "They're alive, like me."</p>
            <p>As Mills is about to put the Indominus rex fragment into the car, a stampede sound can be heard. As one of the men goes to investigate, a Pteranodon snatches and drops him onto Millsâ€™ car, killing him. The now free dinosaurs begin to stampede out of the mansion, trampling another guard to death. Mills immediately takes refuge under the car, which is quickly trampled and destroyed in the stampede. As Mills gets up from underneath his wrecked car and tries to pick up the I. rex fragment, the T. rex suddenly appears and snatches him in her jaws, brutally shredding him before tearing him in half with a Carnotaurus, and ultimately devouring Mills, the T. rex then knocks over the Carnotaurus with her head scaring it off in the process. The T. rex triumphantly roars and walks away, destroying the I. rex fragment in the process and ensuring that no carnivorous hybrid can ever wreak havoc upon the world again.</p>
            <p>Owen, Claire, Franklin, Zia, and Maisie all exit through the entrance of the Lockwood Manor, where Blue reunites with Owen. She does not attack the group and Blue and Owen connect briefly with Owen tearfully accepting his bond with the raptor and that he cares deeply for the animal. Owen instructs for Blue to accompany him and promises he will keep her safe from now on, however, Blue denies him when sensing his meaning as being back in an enclosure. She departs into the California wilderness as Owen and Maisie look on.</p>
            <p>Flashing back to the Senate Hearing from the beginning of the film, Ian Malcolm sums up his thoughts and arguments as the world is shown changed. At an unknown beach, the Mosasaurus attacks surfers in a wave; the old Tyrannosaurus breaks into a zoo and roars at a captive lion that roars right back at her; Owen, Claire and Maisie are seen driving down the highway to an unknown destination as three Pteranodons fly past them along the coast; and Blue is shown running and jumping onto a cliff overlooking a suburban neighborhood below, signifying that dinosaurs and humans must now co-exist with one another, and calls out four times, into the sunset. Ian Malcolm closes out his argument with a final statement: "Welcome to Jurassic World".</p>
            <p>In a post-credits scene, the three Pteranodons fly around and ultimately settle down on the Eiffel Tower replica in Las Vegas.</p>
