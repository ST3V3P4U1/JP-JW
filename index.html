        <h1>The Jurassic Franchise</h1>
        <p>The Jurassic Franchise is a sci-fi universe consisting of 6 movies and 2 series. The Franchise was popularised by the first film, Jurassic Park. Jurassic Park was so influential, it even made McDonalds keep the larger sizes of food after their Jurassic Park partnership.</p>
        <p>I first saw Jurassic Park when I was 4 years old. I came home from kindergarten in Dubai and saw my parents watching it. It was the part where the Tyrannosaur escaped. I vividly remember the lawyer, Genarro, being eaten directly off the restroom and I chuckled to myself</p>
        <p>When I was five, Jurassic World released and I saw it in theatres. After I saw that film, I decided what my 5-year old autistic brain would be hyper-fixated on, dinosaurs!</p>
        <p>In 2018, when Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom released, my eight year old brain somehow tricked my year 2 teacher into showing the class a M rated trailer to a bunch of 8-year-olds.</p>
        <p>2021, I saw a clip about these two kids escaping a Carnotaurus and I wondered what knockoff show it was. Then I realised, it was Camp Cretaceous, a series about 6 kids who are stranded on Isla Nublar. I was so intrigued by it, I convinced my parents to get Netflix.</p>
        <p>2022, Jurassic World Dominion released. That film changed me as a person. I was so mesmerised by all the dinosaurs that I completely ignored the plot. Once the film was over, I cried, knowing I likely wouldn't see another movie for my beloved franchise ever.</p>
        <p>And here we are, 2024, I got the park management game, Jurassic World Evolution 2, watched the newest series that has released; Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous: Chaos Theory. And now, for 2025, there are 2 new games in the works, a new season for Chaos Theory and a new Jurassic World film!</p>
